// Customer-uploaded government IDs, APS agreements and retainer PDFs were written
// to Vercel Blob with access:"public", so anyone holding the URL could open the
// file with no auth. This module lets us store them privately and serve them only
// through the auth-gated download proxy (/api/documents/download), which verifies
// the logged-in customer actually owns the document.
//
// Rollout is env-gated so the portal and admin deploys don't have to land
// atomically:
//   NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_BLOB unset / "false" -> new uploads stay PUBLIC exactly
//       as before. Ships dormant; nothing changes.
//   NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_BLOB = "true"         -> new uploads are PRIVATE and are
//       read back through the proxy. Flip this in BOTH repos together.
//
// Detection is by URL host: Vercel encodes the access level into the hostname as
//   https://<store>.<access>.blob.vercel-storage.com/<pathname>
// so every stored URL is self-describing — a `.private.` host means "proxy it",
// a `.public.` (or legacy) host means "serve directly". No database column or
// backfill is needed: old public rows keep working untouched.
//
// This module is isomorphic (no server-only imports) so it can be used from both
// client components and server routes. Keep it in sync with the admin repo's copy.
