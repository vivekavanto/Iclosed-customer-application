 * Resolves a transaction family's "Who will be uploading your documents?" answer.
 *
 * The decision lives on the PRIMARY lead's `upload_mode` column (see
 * sql/add_lead_upload_mode.sql). Pass ANY lead id in the family — primary or a
 * co-person — and this follows `parent_lead_id` up to the primary and reads it.
 *
 * Returns null when the popup hasn't been answered yet (or there are no
 * co-persons, so it never showed). Callers treat null like "me" — a single
 * uploader, no cross-party access beyond the existing `upload_mode` rules.
